# Kotlin Spring Boot Multi Project

This project is my playground I created while reading [Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture](https://reflectoring.io/book/)
by Tom Hombergs. Since I like Kotlin I will translate his example project step by step to Kotlin. During this endeavor
I will try out additional tools, concepts and libraries which I deem interesting.

## TODO

- Implement the core domain
  - Create value objects and entities âœ…
  - Create use cases
  - Create proper ports
  - Create tests
